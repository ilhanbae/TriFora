# Alternate Dispute Resolution:
* We should always carefully consider how each opinion can be a better option than others by weighing the pros and cons of each.
* We will resolve conflicts via rock-paper-scissors; each opposing party will have a representative chosen randomly, and all members will be present during the session.

# Expected Outcome:
* A social media platform that allows students to create different communities, share ideas and information, and connect with other like-minded students in small communities to make their academic years memorable.

# Expected Users:
We expect the following types of users on our platform:
* A student who’s looking to connect with other like-minded students to share information and thoughts.
* A student club or student organization president looking to host and attract students to upcoming events.
* A student who’s looking for campus job opportunities or research projects that are currently available.
* An incoming student who recently moved into a new place and is looking to buy used furniture from reliable sellers from university. 
* A graduating student who’s looking to sell his or her furniture to other needed students before leaving university.
* A student who’s looking for roommates and off-campus housing that are currently available.
