# Alternate Dispute Resolution:
* We should always carefully consider how each opinion can be a better option than others by weighing the pros and cons of each.
* We will resolve conflicts via rock-paper-scissors; each opposing party will have a representative chosen randomly, and all members will be present during the session.

# Expected Outcome:
* A social media platform (technically, a social-commerce platform), where students can buy & sell their short-lived furniture and connect with other like-minded students in small communities to make their academic years memorable.

# Expected Users:
We expect the following types of users on our platform:
* An incoming student who recently moved into a new place and is looking to buy used furniture from reliable sellers from university. 
* A graduating student who’s looking to sell his or her furniture before leaving.
* Current student who’s looking to connect with other students to share useful information.
