Team Contract

Expectations: 
(1) We can make a checklist of skills/areas of expertise that would be helpful for the project and each of us can fill out whatever we're good at so we can contribute to the project together 
(2) Make sure the goals we set are attainable and realistic in the time frame we have 
(3) I think we could look into what each of us is good at or interested at, and assign tasks accordingly 

Unique Skills: 
Benson: I have experience working in and with groups before 
Neil: I took a 4 semesters gap from 2020 - 2022 to serve at military in my home country; I was a signaler performing radio communications across branches 
Joe: I am older than many of the students around us, as well as have lived on my own for some time already, with that perhaps I can bring a certain perspective to discussions 
Tom: I can bring some perspectives from Eastern culture
Jay: I'm able to communicate my thoughts and ideas clearly 

Communication: 
Primary: Discord
Secondary: Groupme or In Person 

Conflicts: 
I think we can resolve conflict via rock-paper-scissors to arrive at one agreement, but we should also carefully consider how each opinion can be a better option than others by weighing the pros and cons of each.
