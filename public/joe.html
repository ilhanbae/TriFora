        <h1>Joe's about me</h1>

        <img src = Captain_Ed.jpg />
        <p> I'm Joe, currently a senior in UB's Computer Science program that comes from Long Island, NY.</p>
        <p> Some of the things I enjoy include video games, basketball, and board games.</p>
        <p> Usually I'm pretty hypercompetitive with everything and enjoy things that have a good component of strategy to them.</p>
        <p> I consider myself most proficient with Java, but I enjoy coding in order to create creative solutions to creative problems.</p>
